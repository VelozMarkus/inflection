INFLECTION
==========

The Java Inflection API reduces the amount of boilerplate code by (virtually) extending the Java type system with so-called "class views".

Applications include reusable implementions for base functions, such as hashcode(), equals(), toString() and clone() as well as more advanced functions, such as JPA persistence and JSON serialization.

If you have stumbled across this page please note that while the API is being used on a number of projects at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (http://www.zhaw.ch) it is not quite ready for general use at this time. We are still working on the code and documentation and will update this REAME when it is ready to try out.
