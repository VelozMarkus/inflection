PARSING

Parse the source files and set the values for CompilationUnitParsed accordingly. Store any error or warnings
in CompilationUnit.compilationFaults.

1. For each CompilationUnit in CompilationJob:
	1.1. Create a parse tree for the compilation unit located under CompilationUnitRaw.sourceFileName using
		 the antlr generated lexer and parser. Store the tree and tokens in CompilationUnitParsed.
	1.2. Any errors or warnings generated during step 1.1. are stored in CompilationUnit.compilationFaults.
2. Output any errors or warnings.
3. If any errors occurred then skip the second pass.


PASS 1

Processing:

Identify the package name and the imports for the compilation unit. Resolve any wildcard imports to the set
of all classes in that package. Create a lookup table associating simple names with (possibly multiple, i.e.
ambiguous) fully qualified names. Created taxonomies (name only) and enter them into the symbol table.

1. For each CompilationUnit in CompilationJob, walking the parse tree:
	1.2. Set CompilationUnitCompiled.packageName.
	1.3. For each imported class --> enter class into CompilationUnitCompiled.importedClasses.
	1.4. For each imported package:
		1.4.1. Determine the set of imported classes using the reflections API.
		1.4.2. Process classes as described in 1.3.
	1.5. For each taxonomy --> enter taxonomy into CompilationUnitCompiled.taxonomiesCompiled and
	     CompilationUnit.knownTaxonomiesCompiled
	     
Errors:

-The package name does not correspond with the source file name.
-Classes specified in imports cannot be located (i.e., loaded through the class loader).
-Two taxonomies have the same name.

Warnings:

-Duplicate imports.
-Unused imports.


PASS 2

Processing:

Add views and members to the taxonomies; define all attributes, including annotations, selection types,
aliases, access types, default access types and used classes. Also, define generalization relationships
between taxonomies.

[TODO: Describe individual steps as well as error handling]

1. For each CompilationUnit in CompilationJob:
	1.1. For each Taxonomy in CompilationUnit:
		1.1.1. For the following items, simply transfer their values to the appropriate locations
		       in the compiled class hierarchy:
			1.1.1.1. Extended taxonomies.
			1.1.1.2. Annotations.
			1.1.1.3. Aliases.
			1.1.1.4. Default access type.
			1.1.1.5. Access type.
		1.1.2. Class selectors: resolve any wildcards by matching the selector against all imported
			   classes --> selected classes.
		1.1.3. For each selected class:
			1.1.3.1. Let the set of potential members be the set of declared members (i.e., fields
					 or methods, whatever the case may be) plus the set of members (getters and setters)
					 defined by the used classes (note that the access type is ignored for members
					 stemming from used classes).
			1.1.4.1. Resolve the actual members by comparing each member selector with the set of
					 potential members.

Errors:

-Generalization relationship graph contains cycles.
-Super taxonomy does not exist (should be located in symbol table or through class loader).
-Used class does not exist.
-Two aliases have the same name.
-Names of members defined by used classes are ambiguous.

Warnings:

-Class or method selector matches nothing.

SAVING

Save the taxonomies to the target directory.
